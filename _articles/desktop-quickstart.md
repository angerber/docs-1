Congratulations on receiving your System76 Desktop! Read this article to get started quickly.

### Connect Your Monitor

![Ports](/images/desktop-quickstart/thelio-r1_b1.png)

If you ordered a dedicated graphics card, plug your monitor into one of the horizontal ports on the back of the machine. Do not connect your display to the vertical ports if you have a graphics card. The vertical ports are directly connected to the motherboard and are disabled by default if there is a dedicated graphics card.

### Connect Keyboard and Mouse

Keyboards can connect via USB ports or wirelessly. If your keyboard/mouse connects wirelessly, you should have a small USB device, called a receiver, that connects to the desktop and communicates with your keyboard and mouse via radio frequency. This should be included when you purchase a wireless keyboard or mouse. You can connect to the front USB ports or the back, depending on where your cords will extend/fit.

### Connect Power Supply

The power supply is located on the bottom of the back of the desktop. Use the cord provided to connect the computer to the nearest outlet.

### Power On

Press the circular button on the front of the machine after all components are plugged in. The power button is the largest button on the front of the machine.

### Set Up User Account

When you power on, you'll be prompted to create a user account, which is the administrative account (root). The password you set for this account will be the main password for when you install applications or updates, or add new users to the computer. In Pop!_OS, you can choose to encrypt your hard drive while setting up the user account. 

You will be prompted for the encryption passphrase first if you select that option during the account creation process. After the encryption passphrase is set, you will proceed to set up a user account and be prompted to set the administrator password. If you encrypt your hard drive, you will be prompted for the encryption passphrase every time you power on.

***IMPORTANT: Write your password down and keep it somewhere safe. If the password is lost or forgotten, you will lose access to all contents of the drive.
